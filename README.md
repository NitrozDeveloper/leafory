## üìÇ Folder Structure

The project follows a clean and scalable directory structure to facilitate easy navigation and development.

```
lib/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ core/              # For shared logic, services, and utilities (Routing, Dependency Injection, Theme, Database Service, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ features/          # For individual feature modules (e.g., book_discovery)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ domain/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ presentation/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ shared/            # For shared, reusable UI widgets
```
